Certification of profit or not-for-profit entities — limitation on insurance companies, management or direction of certified capital company — seventy-five days to issue or refuse certification — responsibility for administration of tax credits — rulemaking authority. —
The department may certify profit or not-for-profit entities which submit an application to be designated as a Missouri certified capital company.  The department shall review the organizational documents for each applicant for certification and the business history of the applicant, determine that the Missouri certified capital company's cash, marketable securities and other liquid assets are at least five hundred thousand dollars, determine that the liquid asset base for certified companies is at least five hundred thousand dollars at all times during the company's participation in the program authorized by sections
135.500 to 135.529
, and determine that the officers and the board of directors, partners, trustees or managers are thoroughly acquainted with the requirements of sections
135.500 to 135.529
. No insurance company which receives tax credits permitted under sections
135.500 to 135.529
for an investment in a Missouri certified capital company shall, individually or with or through one or more affiliates, be a managing general partner of or control the direction of investments of that Missouri certified capital company.  Within seventy-five days of application, the department shall either issue the certification and notify the department of revenue and the director of the department of commerce and insurance of such certification or shall refuse the certification and communicate in detail to the applicant the grounds for the refusal, including the suggestions for the removal of those grounds.  The department shall be responsible for the administration of the tax credits authorized by sections
135.500 to 135.529
.  No rule or portion of a rule promulgated under the authority of sections
135.500 to 135.529
shall become effective unless it has been promulgated pursuant to the provisions of
chapter 536
.  All rulemaking authority delegated prior to June 27, 1997, is of no force and effect and repealed; however, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to repeal or affect the validity of any rule filed or adopted prior to June 27, 1997, if such rule complied with the provisions of
chapter 536
.  The provisions of this section and
chapter 536
are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to
chapter 536
, including the ability to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule or portion of a rule, are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the purported grant of rulemaking authority and any rule so proposed and contained in the order of rulemaking shall be invalid and void.
