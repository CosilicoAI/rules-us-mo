            <akn:p>"Property taxes accrued"
, property taxes paid, exclusive of special assessments, penalties, interest, and charges for service levied on a claimant's homestead in any calendar year.  Property taxes shall qualify for the credit only if actually paid prior to the date a return is filed.  The director of revenue shall require a tax receipt or other proof of property tax payment.  If a homestead is owned only partially by claimant, then property taxes accrued is that part of property taxes levied on the homestead which was actually paid by the claimant.  For purposes of this subdivision, property taxes are
"levied"
when the tax roll is delivered to the director of revenue for collection.  If a claimant owns a homestead part of the preceding calendar year and rents it or a different homestead for part of the same year, property taxes accrued means only taxes levied on the homestead both owned and occupied by the claimant, multiplied by the percentage of twelve months that such property was owned and occupied as the homestead of the claimant during the year.  When a claimant owns and occupies two or more different homesteads in the same calendar year, property taxes accrued shall be the sum of taxes allocable to those several properties occupied by the claimant as a homestead for the year.  If a homestead is an integral part of a larger unit such as a farm, or multipurpose or multidwelling building, property taxes accrued shall be that percentage of the total property taxes accrued as the value of the homestead is of the total value.  For purposes of this subdivision
"unit"
refers to the parcel of property covered by a single tax statement of which the homestead is a part;</akn:p>
